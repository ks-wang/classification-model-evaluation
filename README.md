# Classification Model Evaluation Report

## Introduction:

In this report, we will discuss the implementation and evaluation of various classification algorithms on a weather dataset. The dataset contains weather observations for different locations from 2008 to 2017, and the task is to predict whether it will rain tomorrow (Yes/No) based on the weather metrics for a particular day. The algorithms used for classification are Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Analysis:

### Data Preprocessing:
- The dataset was imported, and one-hot encoding was performed to convert categorical variables into binary variables.
- The 'RainTomorrow' column was converted from categorical to binary representation (0 for 'No' and 1 for 'Yes').

### Linear Regression:
- The data was split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
- A Linear Regression model was trained using the training data.
- The model was used to make predictions on the test data.
- Evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, and R2) were calculated to assess the model's performance.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
- The data was split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
- A KNN model with 'n_neighbors' set to 4 was trained using the training data.
- The model was used to make predictions on the test data.
- Evaluation metrics (Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, and Log Loss) were calculated to assess the model's performance.

### Decision Trees:
- The data was split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
- A Decision Tree model with 'max_depth' set to 4 was trained using the training data.
- The model was used to make predictions on the test data.
- Evaluation metrics (Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, and Log Loss) were calculated to assess the model's performance.

### Logistic Regression:
- The data was split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
- A Logistic Regression model with 'solver' set to 'liblinear' was trained using the training data.
- The model was used to make predictions on the test data.
- Evaluation metrics (Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, and Log Loss) were calculated to assess the model's performance.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM):
- The data was split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
- A SVM model with 'kernel' set to 'linear' was trained using the training data.
- The model was used to make predictions on the test data.
- Evaluation metrics (Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, and Log Loss) were calculated to assess the model's performance.

## Conclusion:

In this classification model evaluation report, we applied various algorithms to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on weather metrics. The models were trained and evaluated using different evaluation metrics. Here are the results:

- The Linear Regression model showed a variance score of 0.43, indicating moderate predictive power for the given data.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) achieved an accuracy score of 81.83%, a Jaccard Index of 0.43, an F1-Score of 0.60, and a Log Loss of 6.28.
- Decision Trees also had an accuracy score of 81.83%, a Jaccard Index of 0.48, an F1-Score of 0.65, and a Log Loss of 6.28.
- Logistic Regression performed slightly better with an accuracy score of 82.75%, a Jaccard Index of 0.48, an F1-Score of 0.65, and a Log Loss of 5.96.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) had the highest accuracy score of 83.36%, a Jaccard Index of 0.50, an F1-Score of 0.66, and a Log Loss of 5.75.
- Based on the evaluation metrics, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model seems to be the best performing algorithm for this task. However, further tuning and optimization may be required to improve the overall model performance.
